# Markdown Documentation example

This is an example of weld markdown documentation in [Repository](https://github.com/WeldHQ/integrations-documentation).

## Seccondary headline

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.  
To create a line break (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.  
Keep lines left-aligned like this.

To start a new paragraph, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

> This text is inside in a "blockquote"
>
> - Blockquote can display other markdown elements like lists
> - Or **Strong words** or _italic words_
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
`const aString = "hello world;"`

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses.
